            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Muſt acquaint you with a ſad ſtory, of a fearfull conflict betwixt the Scotch women and the Presbyters, in the Town of Dunin, in the County of Pearth, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ninth of this inſtant, thus:</p>
            <p>Vpon the eighth our Scotch women Dragooners of the Province (being big with child of a ſtrong fancy, that their
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:118313:3"/>inheritance was invaded by ſome of their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, formerly depoſed for their diſlike of that Sinodicall Government (reſolved to bee brought to bed at this little Hamlet, where af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a long congratulatory proſopopia of the good ſucceſſe of their deformed reformation, ordered thoſe Preachers who had re-inveſted themſelves, both with the Church and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings (by vertue of a Call from their Pariſhio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners) to be cited to appeare on the morrow at ten houres in the fore-noon, under paine of that fearefull Bull of Excommunication, in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience whereof the Inditement is preſented by the Officer to the Wives, in their Husbands abſence, who promiſed to be with them on the morrow, and to be as aſſiſting as poſſible they could, for curing their mallady; that night the Women were moſt carefull, in draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together their Forces, and having met a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout four in the morning, they went to a wood hard by, and each of them provided a ſtrong Club (they being about one hundred and twenty in number) with a loud Bag-pipe, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter foure miles march, furpriſed the Towne, and poſſeſſed themſelves of the Church-yard,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:118313:3"/>one of thoſe flea-bitten Synod is ſent to thoſe Amazons, to ſee if the Brethren might meet in the Church, as had formerly been appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; which being denied, he threatens them with Bell, Booke, and Candle, and they baſte him for his paines, detaine him Priſoner, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpatches ſixty of their number to ſurpriſe the remainder in the Market-place, the order was inſtantly executed with ſo much life, that all their Body was broken, and routed in their ſeverall Parties, that they loſt all their Baggage, and twelve of their beſt Horſes in the Conflict, one Rollock getting out of the throng with loſſe of Horſe, Hat, and Cloak, ſaved himſelfe in the end of a Land, a ſecond ſorely affright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and bruiſed with ſtroakes, after a miles run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, taking all the Creatures of the field for his enemies, with a ſuperſtitiouſly bended knee, did beg quarter of a Souldier, who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding nothing of the matter deſired to know his meaning; the honeſt Preacher (ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed with the feare of his former danger) without reply fell to the ground; in the meane time, thoſe victorious Gallants having laid hold on the Synods Clerke for a Preacher, did

            <p n="1">1 That never any Provinciall Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, ſhould ſit at the fore-named Dunine, but that the ſame ſhould be accurſed, and that every ninth of June ſhould be a feaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vall day for their great deliverance.</p>
